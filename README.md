## Teams:
* The unit is on Teams at [[COMS20017: Algorithms & Data 24-25]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3AC3pt4BfooTltDJ9rfiA7YLVVMK39ksdRN9t3H6R9EQQ1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=7cdfd411-53c6-47a6-8bab-44073d5c6fb4&tenantId=b2e47f30-cd7d-4a4e-a5da-b18cf1a4151b).  You should have access already through the "Teams" panel.  If not, please get in touch with the COMS Student Enquiries Mailbox at coms-student-enquiries@bristol.ac.uk. Please make sure you set NOTIFICATIONS to ON for this channel.

You should use the Teams channel for raising queries on any aspects of the COMS20017 Data unit - such queries will not normally be answered via email or via personal Teams messages. Please do not get upset if your query is not answered by email/Teams when on a one-to-one basis. Post your query on the unit Teams channel for the benefit of others who may have the same query.

## Exam info:
* This Data part of the unit is assessed 100% by a multiple-choice exam.
* The exam is closed-book (so no additional materials are allowed).
* Past exam papers (on COMS20011 "Data-Driven CS") included a formulae sheet. This is NOT THE CASE FOR THE DATA PART OF COMS20017.
* If you have any questions regarding alternative exam arrangements, please get in touch with the COMS Student Enquiries Mailbox at coms-student-enquiries@bristol.ac.uk
* Further info will appear here in due course.

Past paper examples will appear here in due course.
