## Schedule:
```diff
+ Lectures: (Weeks 13-24, but see Exception below regarding Week 15!)
  - Mondays 3pm in PHYS BLDG G42 POWELL
  - Thursdays 2pm in PHYS BLDG G42 POWELL
  - EXCEPTION: There will be no lectures in Week 15. The two lectures for that week are re-assigned as follows:
     - Week 14: Thursday 3pm in PHYS BLDG G42 POWELL (this lecture follows the regular 2pm Thursday lecture)
     - Week 17: Thursday 3pm in PHYS BLDG G42 POWELL (this lecture follows the regular 2pm Thursday lecture)
  - No lectures in Reading Week 18.
+ Labs: 1 hour per week, starting Jan 17th. To establish what group you're in, look in your Outlook calendar!  You will see one of the following two slots:
  - Group 1: Fridays 1-2pm in MVB 2.11
  - Group 2: Fridays 2-3pm in MVB 2.11
```

## Lecture recordings:
All lecture recordings eventually appear on Blackboard a few hours after the event. Click on Re/Play on the left menu bar on the BB course webpage to find them.

## Labs:

* The labs come with exercises as Python notebooks.  
* A new set of exercises will be released every _TWO_ weeks.
* Material in the labs may appear in the exam.
* The labs are the primary route for feedback on all aspects of the course, including lectures, any problem sheets and exams, not just the labs!
* The lab exercises will be released in the /Labs/ folder. See top of this page.

## Teams:
* The unit is on Teams at [[COMS20017: Algorithms & Data 24-25]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3AC3pt4BfooTltDJ9rfiA7YLVVMK39ksdRN9t3H6R9EQQ1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=7cdfd411-53c6-47a6-8bab-44073d5c6fb4&tenantId=b2e47f30-cd7d-4a4e-a5da-b18cf1a4151b).  You should have access already through the "Teams" panel.  If not, please get in touch with the COMS Student Enquiries Mailbox at coms-student-enquiries@bristol.ac.uk. Please make sure you set NOTIFICATIONS to ON for this channel.

You should use the Teams channel for raising queries on any aspects of the COMS20017 Data unit - such queries will not normally be answered via email or via personal Teams messages. Please do not get upset if your query is not answered by email/Teams when on a one-to-one basis. Post your query on the unit Teams channel for the benefit of others who may have the same query.

## Exam info:
* This Data part of the unit is assessed 100% by a multiple-choice exam.
* The exam is closed-book (so no additional materials are allowed).
* Past exam papers (on COMS20011 "Data-Driven CS") included a formulae sheet, as can be seen in the papers below. This WILL NOT BE THE CASE FOR THE DATA PART OF COMS20017.
* If you have any questions regarding alternative exam arrangements, please get in touch with the COMS Student Enquiries Mailbox at coms-student-enquiries@bristol.ac.uk

## Past exam papers of COMS20011:
| Year  | Paper | Answers | Questions to IGNORE! |
| ----- | ----- | ------- | -------------------- |
| 22/23 | [pdf](/Past_Exams/main_2223.pdf) | [pdf](/Past_Exams/main_2223_answers.pdf) |2,3,8 |

Important notes:
* Please note, these are past exam papers for COMS20011 unit.
* We have rejigged the course content a bit over the last couple of years so some questions are no longer relevant.  These questions are in the "Questions to IGNORE!" column.
